# Health-Technologies-2022-2023
This repository contains the material that the Health Technologies 2022-2023 class created during the course: there are Python codes and there is also our final report of the laboratory experience, a brief powerpoint explaination and three appendices in which we stored images, boxplots, etc. that we produced during the different analyses.

We focused on two analyses in particular: PSA and Connectome analyses. 

These analyses required the preprocessing of the raw EEG signals collected in the laboratory. The raw EEG signals preprocessing was achieved using EEGLAB, a Matlab extension software that is very known in the field of Electroencephalography. Moreover, EEGLAB was useful to perform the PSA analysis too.

So far, there isn't any code explaining the preprocessing procedure and the PSA analysis.
However, the main logical passages to perform on EEGLAB to clean data and to compute PSA are explained here:
