# Health-Technologies-2022-2023
This repository contains the codes that Health Technologies 2022-2023 class created and used in order to perform the Connectome Analysis on the EEG signals collected during the laboratory. The repository also contains our final report of the laboratory experience, a brief powerpoint explaination and appendices in which we collected images, boxplots, etc. that we produced during the different analysis.

The preprocessing of the raw EEG signals was done on EEGLAB, a Matlab extension. So, for now, there isn't any code explaining the preprocessing procedure.
